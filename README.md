# E-Commerce-Analytics-Hub

An interactive web application for managing and analyzing online businesses, providing insights into sales, finances, and risk assessment.

This program is like a smart assistant for your online business. Imagine you have a magical shelf that keeps track of your products and how many you've sold. Well, the program helps you add new items to this shelf and shows you what's left. When you make sales, it remembers all the details like the date and the stuff you sold. It even helps with advertisements â€“ you can tell it about your ads, and it keeps a record.

Now, here's the cool part: it's like a fortune teller for your business finances. It guesses how much money you might make based on what you're selling and how much you're spending on ads. If you want to know how well you're doing with sales, it gives you numbers like how many orders you've got and how much people are spending on average. You can even look at sales for specific time periods like months.

And when you want to see the big picture, it gives you a summary of everything. It shows you charts that divide your budget into pieces for different things like sales, marketing, and more. It also crunches numbers to tell you how much money is coming in, how much profit you're making after costs, and how well you're managing your money. It even rates your financial health with letters like A, B, C, and so on. Plus, it gives you a letter grade that tells you how risky things are financially.

In short, it's like a helper that manages your business numbers, gives you insights, and tells you if things are going well or if there's some risk you should be aware of.
